<h1>ReactJS Pokedex</h1>

<h4>Project I made to practice and study how to consume APIs, deploy my react-app to github-pages and ReactJS in general.</h4>
<br>

I have some ideas for the future:
- Search pokemons when the user press enter on the searchbar.
- Light / Dark Theme.
- Show detailed information on a modal menu, when a pokemon is clicked.
